RNA sequencing data for anatomic structures and putative cancer stem cell 
clusters isolated by laser microdissection. 

The data set includes 122 RNA samples of 5 anatomic structures 
(Leading Edge, Infiltrating Tumor, Cellular Tumor, Microvascular 
Proliferation, and Pseudopalisading Cells Around Necrosis) identified 
by H&E staining in 10 tumors, and 148 RNA samples of putative cancer 
stem cell clusters identified by ISH with 18 probe reference set in 34 tumors.

The sequencing results were aligned and aggregated at the gene level using the 
RSEM algorithm, and the resulting fpkm values were normalized across all 
samples based on genes not enriched in particular anatomic structures.

application.


fpkm_table.csv
	Contains the (row, column) matrix of fpkm values obtained for each (gene, sample).
	The first row contains the sample unique identifiers (rna_well_id)
	The first column contains the gene unique identifiers (gene_id)


columns-samples.csv 
	Contains information about the samples profiled with RNA sequencing
		
	tumor_id, block_id, specimen_id and corresponding names
		Specimen from which the sample was dissected and the 
                specimen's parent block and tumor.

	rna_well_id
		Unique identifier of the sample.

	polygon_id
		Unique identifier of an avg_graphic_object that outlines 
                where the sample was cut from.
			

	structure_id, structure_abbreviation, structure_color, structure_name
		Label that groups samples obtained from laser micro-dissected 
                anatomic structures or putative cancer stem cell clusters.


rows-genes.csv
	Contains information about the genes for which fpkm values were calculated. 

	gene_id
		Unique identifier for the gene.

	chromosome
		Chromosome associated with the gene.

	gene_entrez_id, gene_symbol, gene_name
		entrez_id, NCBI symbol, and name of the gene.
